<P>The interior of the church, even more than the exterior, preserves the general appearance of a medieval building, though the whole of the eastern half of it dates only from 1860-1 or later. Much of the original material was re-used in the extensions and rebuilding then carried out, and the general style of the new work is so similar to the old that it is not at all easy, at first sight, to tell where one begins and the other leaves off. However, a careful inspection of the third arch from the west, on either side, will show the join. Though relatively little survives of the medieval building, that little is of great interest if only as a historical puzzle. </P>
<P>The present arcades of the nave (save the easternmost pillar and arch on each side) are thought to be of the fourteenth century, though the mouldings are so simple that it would be difficult to date them with any precision. The tower and tower-arch, as they stand, belong to the fifteenth century or later, and an examination of the masonry of the west wall of the nave will show that the south arcade (or possibly the wall that preceded it) was at some date moved about five feet to the south. This explains why the tower-arch is not in the centre of the nave; and the unbalanced effect which this produces in any interior view of the church looking westward is intensified by the fact that the west window, in the tower, is itself not in the centre of the tower, being pushed to the north by the tower staircase. It will he noticed that the two ancient pillars and the western respond of the south aisle are set on bases that look like capitals reversed, while those on the north side have bases that do indeed look like bases though they do not fit the pillars. The central pillar on the north side has a roughly carved capital which is medieval though difficult to date more closely; and there is decoration also on the base of the western respond of the south arcade. The three western bays of the nave clerestory are ancient, save that the south side was re-faced on the exterior, if not rebuilt, in 1860-1, and windows were cut in the north side in 1880. The western three bays of the north aisle are medieval. Doorway and windows (except the west window which is modern) are probably of the late fifteenth or early sixteenth century, though the window&shy;sills are modern replacements and the doorway has been made higher to correspond with a raising of the floor level. The south aisle, as it is at present, dates from 1860-1; so also do the east bays of the nave and aisles, the chancel, the present churchwardens\' vestry and the organ chamber. The clergy vestry was built in 1880, choir vestry and chapel in 1927. A plaque in the chapel states that it and the choir vestry were erected in commemoration of the thirteenth centenary of the foundation of the church. </P>
<P>There are good reasons for thinking that Ilkley church is a very early foundation, but none whatever for ascribing it precisely to the year 627. The chapel was furnished as a war memorial and dedicated by the bishop of Brad&shy;ford in 1948. The furnishings were designed by the Warham Guild.</P>
