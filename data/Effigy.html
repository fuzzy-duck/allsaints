<P>The effigy of Sir Adam or Peter de Myddleton, is identified by the Middleton Family crest on his shield.&nbsp; The Middletons held extensive lands in this part of the West Riding for many centuries. The land north of the River Wharfe is still today named after the family descendants of one of William the Conqueror\'s Barons.</P>
<P>This effigy was originally in St Nicholas chantry, in a niche on the south aisle behind the organ console.</P>
<P>Sir Peter died in 1336 and his services to the king seem to have been judicial and administrative as well as military, for he was one of the royal justices and was appointed shrriff of Yorkshire in 1335.</P>
<P>At the time of the reconstruction of the church in 1860, William Middleton acknowledged his obligation to maintain the chancel as rector and contributed to the cost of its rebuilding.</P>

<P>Of the monuments in the church the most remarkable is the <STRONG>Middleton effigy</STRONG>, now placed in a modern niche in the Chapel. Although it has been ascribed to his forbears, it now seems to be generally agreed that it commemorates Sir Peter Middleton who died in 1336, though it may well have been made some time before his death. This Peter was born c.1290 into a family which held extensive lands in this part of the West Riding for many centuries. His services to the king seem to have been judicial and administrative as well as military, for he was one of the royal justices in Yorkshire on many occasions from 1327, and he was sheriff of Yorkshire in 1335.</P>
<P>He is represented as lying cross-legged, with his head resting on a pillow supported by angels (only one survives), his feet on a lion. He wears a round-topped skull cap, hidden under a hood-of mail; his hands, uplifted in prayer, are protected by mail gauntlets secured at the wrists by buckled leather straps. A guige or sling. pas<SUP><FONT size=2>s</FONT></SUP>ing over his right shoulder, carried his shield, which bears the Middleton arms -- <EM>(Argent) fretty (sable) with a canton of the </EM><EM>second. </EM></P>
<P>The surcoat, a long garment often of silk, reaches almost to his ankles and is girt at the waist by a narrow, buckled strap, the end of which is looped up and tucked under at the right side. Under the surcoat may be seen the hauberk of mail, and underneath that again the bottom of the gambeson, a padded leather garment which carried the weight of the armour and acted as a shock absorber. The knee-cops, of boiled leather, are ridged and decorated with miniature shields: his legs are covered with mail and he wears short prick-spurs. At his side lies his sword in its scabbard, suspended on a sword-belt.</P>
<P>This effigy belongs to a well-known group which is thought to have been made at York. The dating, apart from the style of the armour which is hardly every quite conclusive, is based upon a passage in the will of William Middleton (dated 2 August 1549) who, if he were to die at his manor of Stubham, desired that he should be buried in St. Nicholas quire on the south side of the Parish Church of Ilkley, under the stone where his ancestor, Sir Peter Middleton, lieth\'.</P>
