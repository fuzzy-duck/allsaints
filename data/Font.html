<P><EM>I have called you by name and you are mine, says the Lord (see Isaiah 43.1-7</EM></P>
<P>When Paulinus came to Ilkley in or around AD27, the local adult converts to the Christian faith would have been baptised in the River Wharfe close by, through total immersion, just as Jesus had been in the River Jordan by John the Baptist at the beginning of his earthly ministry and as all early Christians had been down the centuries.</P>
<P>This total immersion in water symbolised death to the old, former self, and the raising to new life in Christ, in a dramatic and distinctive way</P>
<P>In the passage of time, infant baptism was introduced to include children in the church and thus fonts were introduced from early Saxon times. Whilst we are unable to date our font precisely, we know that it is very ancient, that it is made of stone from Ilkley Moor and that it originally it would have been close to the church entrance, to symbolise one\'s first step in the Faith.</P>
<P>The word Font has the same derivation as Fountain and is from the Latin, meaning Living Water. The simple font cover is Jacobean and dates back to 1633. Note the weighted pulley which enables the cover which also acts as a soundboard to be lifted easily to reveal the lead-lined bowl into which the water is poured</P>
<P>Associated with the font is the window immediately to your left on entering the church. It depicts Jesus welcoming little children \",for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these\" (see Mark 10.13-16) and is worth closer examination.</P>

<P>The <STRONG>font</STRONG> is ancient, but of such simple design that it could hardly be dated. &nbsp;Note, however, the marks of a lock and of an attempt to bore a hole for a drain. &nbsp;It was cast out in a nineteenth-century restoration, and spent some time, first in the Vicarage garden, then in the churchyard and later under the tower, before it was eventually restored in 1930. &nbsp;A \'decent font cover\' was ordered to be provided in 1634, and the present cover may well have been made in response to this command. This, too, had been discarded at some restoration. &nbsp;It was preserved at the Vicarage and brought back to the church in 1886.</P>
