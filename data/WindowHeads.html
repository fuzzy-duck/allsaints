<P>Under the tower are to be seen two stones of great interest. They were extracted in 1919 from the structure of the tower. Both are Roman altars in origin. The larger about 3ft 6in high, has the remains of the focus on the upper surface and on the one undamaged side, a female figure which has given rise to many conjectures.</P>
<P>The smaller, now broken in two has a representation of the sacrificial pitcher and patera carved upon it in low relief. If either had an inscription, this was destroyed when a large semi-circular cut was made in each of them.</P>
<P>These cuts suggest that the stones once served as heads for windows or doorways and their scale and general character have been thought to indicate that they were part of an early Anglo-Saxon building.</P>
<P>If this is so they are examples of Roman material re-used at least twice, once in an early Saxon building (a fore-runnerof the present church no doubt), again in the fifteenth century tower,and possibly in a predecessor of the present tower.

<P>Under the tower are to be seen two stones of great interest. They were extracted in 1919, from the structure of the tower. Both are <STRONG>Roman </STRONG><STRONG>altars</STRONG> in origin. The larger, about 3ft. 6in. high, has the remains of the <EM>focus </EM>on the upper surface, and, on the one un&shy;damaged side, a female figure which has given rise to many conjectures. The smaller, now broken in two, has a representation of the sacrificial pitcher and <EM>paters </EM>carved upon it in low relief. If either had an inscription, this was destroyed when a large semi&shy;circular cut was made in each of them. These cuts suggest that the stones once served as heads for windows or doorways, and their scale and general character have been thought to indicate that they were part of an early Anglo-Saxon building. If this is so they are examples of Roman material re-used at least twice, once in an early Saxon building (a fore-runner of the present church no doubt), again in the fifteenth century tower, and possibly in a predecessor of the present tower. They are among the most venerable stones in the Riding.</P>
<P>Near by, in the wall of the tower, one or two other\'rough carvings or scratchings may be made out. Note, also, in the south-western corner of the tower, the original doorway leading to the staircase which gives access to the bell-chamber, and in the north-west corner, the blackening of the stone-work (which may also be seen on one of the Roman altars) indicating the presence here, at one time, of a vestry chimney.</P>
