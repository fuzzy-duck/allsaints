<H1 class=LNE_title>South Porch and Doorway</H1>
<P>The <STRONG>South Porch</STRONG> has been rebuilt and the door is modern: but the doorway is old and can be dated, by the \'dog-tooth\' moulding which adorns it, to the early years of the thirteenth century. It has probably been moved at each successive widening of the nave.</P>
<P>The carved heads of King Edwin of Northumbria and Paulinus, Bishop of York AD627</P>
<P>The two figure heads at the porch entrance depict King Edwin and Bishop Paulinus, the two father-figures who consolidated Christianity in Ilkley and herabouts, and to whom is attributed the founding of this Church in AD 627</P>
