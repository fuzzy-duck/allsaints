<H1 class=LNE_title>Glazed screen with symbols of the crucifixion</H1>
<P>Above the screen door there are illustrated 30 silver coins ;\"When Judas the traitor learnt that Jesus had been condemned, he repented and took back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders....and went and hanged himself....thus came to pass what the prophet Jeremiah had said....\"-Matthew 27.3-10</P>
<P>Then follows the cross and the cruel nails that pierced Jesus\' hands and feet:<BR>\"I often think about the cross and shut my eyes and try to see the cruel nails and crown of thorns and Jesus crucified for me. But even could I see Him die, I could but see a little part of that great love which like a fire is always burning in his heart....\"- Words from the hymn \"It is a thing most wonderful\"</P>
<P>Next follows the sponge soaked in sour wine on the end of a shaft, made from the stalk of a hyssop plant, which was offered to Jesus when He cried out in thirst:<BR>\"A jar of wine vinegar was there so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on the stalk of a hyssop plant and lifted it to Jesus\' lips....\"- John 19.28-30<BR>along with a ladder and a soldier\'s javelin....\" Thus the scripture was fulfilled They will look on the one whom they pierced\"...Read.John 19.31-37</P>
<P>The next shield depicts Christ\'s seamless robe, for which the soldiers gambled, by throwing dice.\" This happened that the scripture that might be fulfilled. They divided my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing\" -John 19.23-24.</P>
<P>Finally ther is the crown of thorns:<BR>\"Then Pilate took Jesus and had Him whipped. The soldiers made a crown out of thorny branches and put it on His head.... so Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and Pilate said \"Behold the man!\" -John 19.1-5</P>
<P>Although Jesus was killed we know that His sacrificial death was not the end of the stoty, for on the third day God raised Christ from the dead.</P>
