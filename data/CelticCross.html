<P>The beautiful worked tapestry of a celtic cross, with its rich variety of colours, surrounded by tongues fire, is the focal point of this holy place and complements the Celtic cross in the modern stained window opposite.</P>
<P>We are reminded of St Patrick, St Columba, St Aidan and St Cuthbert; of the holy islands of Iona and Lindisfarne through whom, and through which, the Holy Spirit worked to bring the Good News of Jesus Christ to northern Britain some time before the arrival of Paulinus, at York in 625.</P>
