<H1 class=LNE_title>Brass Lectern</H1>
<P>At the chancel steps we must admire the fine brass lectern in the form of an EAGLE with wings outstretched to support The Bible, the Word of God. Throughout the the Old Testament, the theme of the redemption of mankind is developed as God unfolds His Covenant with men and nations; whilst in the New Testament all that has been foreshadowed comes to a vibrant and startling reality in the person of Jesus Christ.</P>

<P>It contains a message of eternal hope....<BR>\"<EM>Lift up your eyes and look to the heavens, the Lord is the everlasting God Creator of the ends of the earth. He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak..... those whose hope is in the Lord will renew their strength, they will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not faint</EM>.\" Isaiah 40 v 28-31</P>
<P>When Miles Coverdale\'s Great Bible was first placed in churches for public reading, following Henry VIII th\'s royal proclamation in 1538 Bibles had to be chained to their lecterns so that people could not take them away.</P>
<P>Then, people clamoured round anyone who could read the Bible to them in their mother tongue. These living stones around us have witnessed such scenes! In 1560,the Geneva Bible was published, the very first Bible in which Chapters were divided into verses, later to be replaced by the Authorised Version in1611 under the authority of King James I</P>
<P>Today, this brass eagle holds the New International Version for public reading.</P>
