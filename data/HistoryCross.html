<P>The IIkley Crosses must be considered alongside those at Collingham, Otley, Guiseley, Leeds, Dewsbury and Kildwick. The expert also sees the IIkley Stones in the context of Saxon stones in the British Isles and Western Europe.</P>
<P>The first written reference to the Ilkley Crosses is in Camden\'s \"Brittania\", a history book published in 1596. Camden visited Ilkley in 1592 and saw the broken shafts lying in different parts of the churchyard.</P>
<P>A later description in the 18th century tells of two of them being used as churchyard gateposts, one being severely damaged and defaced. However, one positive outcome of this is that the side that was against the churchyard wall is the best preserved and gives an idea of the detail and depth of carving which they all once had.</P>
<P>The Reverend John Snowdon, Vicar of Ilkley from 1842 to 1878, placed the shafts on the south side of the churchyard, probably as part of the 1861 rebuilding. In 1855 they had been observed stuck in the ground, the tallest shaft being only five foot high, preserving the other four feet under ground.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In 1914 a cross piece was reconstructed from two original pieces and placed on the tallest shaft.</P><STRONG>
<P>In 1983 the Crosses were rescued from the growing atmospheric pollution and placed in the rather cramped display area under the 15th century tower. What a pity the broken shafts were not placed on reconstructed pillars so that they could be seen at the correct height. If one day they could be displayed in a more spacious area, they could be more easily studied and enjoyed with the feeling of the three dominating tall crosses that they once were.</P>
