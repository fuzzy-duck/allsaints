<P>4. The Cross-Piece. The reconstructed cross-piece comprises of two pieces. The lower stone was preserved at the \"Calvary\" constructed by Mr Peter Middleton, who died in 1886. It is described by J. Romilly Allen in his paper to the Yorkshire Archaeological Society excursion to Ilkley in 1884. The upper stone was found in the River Wharfe, also in 1884.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In June 1914, the two stones were presented to the Vicar and Churchwardens by Mr Sydney Kellet of Middleton Lodge and soon fixed to the tallest shaft, still on display on the south side of the church, under the direction of Mr H.B. McCall, F.S.A.</P>
<P>While Professor Collingwood had written to the church in Ilkley in May 1914, together with his sketch of how he believed they had once been (see illustration), he wrote later that year: \" the lower fragment is twenty four inches across the arms, with spatulated arm-ends, eight and a half inches tapering to eight inches broad. The stone is like that of the shafts. The lateral arms show birds pecking fruit, of which the tendrils do not seem to be drawn with the naturalism of earlier Anglian art. The boss, surrounded by three rings, has been chipped off. Perhaps originally they contained a jewel.</P>
<P>The rude angel on the upper stone and the moulding brings this stone to the period of the tallest shaft. It could not possibly have belonged to the shortest of the Crosses.\"</P><EM>
<P>To Christ the King and Judge, all shall one day give account. The message of the four evangelists Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, portrayed on the IIkley Cross, enable seekers after truth to \"believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God\" and that by believing \" <EM>you may have life in His Name\" (St.John </EM>12.31)</P></EM>
<P>The challenge to Ilkley Christians and all Christians is to live out the message of the Cross with lives of sacrifice and service. Each must share the message of the Cross with all who will receive it;</P>
<P>\"God demonstrates His own love for us in this: while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\"</P>
<P>What do these words mean for you?</P>
