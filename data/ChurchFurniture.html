<P>The furniture belongs, for the most part, to the restoration of 1860 and later. There are, however, one or two survivals of older furnishings. The altar-table is ancient, thought to be Elizabethan in origin, though with additions and alterations. At the west end of the north aisle is an enclosed pew, of a kind common enough in the seventeenth century, though there are not now many survivors. It is generally known as the Watkinson Pew. The initials and date I.W. 1633 are carved upon it, and there is an interesting nineteenth-century notice on the door. It is a very agreeable piece of country woodwork. </P>
<P>Five pew-doors survive from the old oak pewing. They are mounted on the west wall of the nave. Of the modern furniture, the most pleasing piece is probably the organ case (1953). The pulpit is a memorial to \'H.B.\' 1889, the lectern to Ada Hirst (1920), the screen of the chapel to Charles Walter Ikin Leather (1873-1939), and the Vicar\'s Stall was presented by Frederick A. Aykroyd, vicar\'s warden, 1911-1916. They are all very characteristic of their date.</P>
