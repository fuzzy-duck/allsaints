<P>For around 1200 years these three Crosses have been powerful silent emblems of the Gospel of Christ in IIkley. From 1860 to the present day is the period of time since the rebuilding and enlarging of the ancient IIkley Parish Church. Consider a similiar period of time between the arrival of the Christian Good News in Ilkley, and the first baptisms, and the certain existence of two, soon to be three, Saxon Crosses. It does not seem very long.</P>
<P>As the ravages of time, weather and ignorant vandalism have taken their toll of these monuments, particularly the environmental pollution of this century, we must be particularly grateful to the archaeologists of the last century like J. Romilly Allen, for detailed sketches based on rubbings and sketches, as found in \"ILKLEY, Ancient and Modern\" (1885). Also we note the meticulous work of Professor W.G. Collingwood, F.S.A., to whose Paper in the Yorkshire Archaeolgical Journal in 1914 I am particularly indebted. Without these drawings when the images were much clearer, the stones would be much harder to interpret.</P>
<P>Monolithic pillars have long been associated with the fertility rites of ancient natural religions.</P>
<P>Those of the Canaanites in Bible times are examples of what was widespread elsewhere. With the conversion of Roman Emperor Constantine to Christianity in 320 A.D., such pillars were capped with crosses to become symbols of purity and landmarks for the preaching of the gospel. There then followed the skilled crafting of Christian crosses. Many were associated with the travels of evangelist Paulinus in the early 7th century.&nbsp; Others were erected as sepulchral monuments for people of substance and station.</P>
<P>That IIkley has three such crosses is remarkable. Consider the quarrying of these large shafts of millstone grit locally, then moving them with great difficulty to the masons\' yard without breaking them, then shaping them, deciding on the design and finally colouring them with red lead and other bright pigments. Finally imagine putting each of them into position on a special stone base with the cross-piece carefully slotted into position.&nbsp; What powerful visual symbols they would be in a non literate age.</P>
<P>Here on one of the IIkley Crosses we have the first visual representation of the Lord Jesus Christ in IIkley, Christ seated in glory with His right hand upraised in blessing and holding a pastoral staff. On the same pillar are the four gospel writers. I cannot imagine the three shafts being carved at the same period, but rather in succession over a hundred years by succeeding generations of masons assisted by travelling masons with design ideas from elsewhere.</P>
<P>The expert can \"read\" the designs -the style of carving, the figures, the beasts, the scrolls, the leaves, the fruits and the Christian symbols. J. Romilly Allen has done a painstaking analysis of all the stone knots and designs, not only at 66 sites in West Yorkshire but also much further afield. He has found common ideas and has put designs into area groupings.</P>
