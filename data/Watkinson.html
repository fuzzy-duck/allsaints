<H1 class=LNE_title>The Watkinson Family Pew 1633</H1>
<P>This is an enclosed box pew of the type often made for families of note in the 17th Century. Few have survived.</P>
<P>This pew would have been typical of the many family pews which would have filled much of the nave from Elizabethan until Victorian times.</P>
<P>The gentry and wealthy families in the locality had their own family crests, replicas of which are displayed on the wall to the right of the Saxon crosses - do go back and take a closer look at them. Can you spot the Watkinson crest?</P>
<P>All such wealthy families would have had similar, ostentatious pews, for which they would have paid an annual rent. Many of the names have a familiar ring, for many of Ilkley\'s streets and roads are named after them, eg Middleton, Margerison, Heber, Lister, Bolling and Cunliffe.</P>
<P>The not- so- well-off would have had to stand during services, or sit on the floor, or if elderly or infirm, would sit on ledges around the perimeter of the church. Hence the saying \"the weakest go to the wall\"</P>
<P>In 1860 all the other family pews except the Watkinson pew, were totally replaced by open-pews, which became free to all when the nave was extended and the church enlarged.</P>
<P>This is a good time to look at the massive wooden beams and roof trusses. Does it remind you of the hull of a ship perhaps? The body of the church is called The Nave from the latin \"Navis\" meaning \" a ship\".</P>
