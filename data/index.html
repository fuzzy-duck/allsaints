<P>Christians have worshipped on this site since about 627 AD. The first church would have been built of stone taken from the abandoned Roman fort of Olicana which stood on this spot. The present building is partly medieval, but it was largely rebuilt in Victorian times, and there have been 20th century additions and alterations. </P>
<P align=center><IMG border=0 alt=\"\" src=\"uploads/church.jpg\"></P>
<P>Each generation has adapted the building to suit its needs, but the Gospel message has remained unchanged throughout the centuries. </P>
<P><STRONG>\'Jesus Christ is the same, yesterday, today and forever\' </STRONG>
<P>Far from being a museum, the church building today is the centre of worship for many local Christian people of all ages.</P>
