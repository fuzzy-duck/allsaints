<P>3. The shortest shaft. This is clearly the top 370 centimetres (54 inches) of a tall shaft. The neck is clear and there is a place in which to slot a cross-piece. See how this shaft has also been used as a gate post.</P>
<P>There is no cable on the edges ( arris ) of the shaft. Unlike the other two shafts there are beasts on all four sides. In addition there is a human figure holding a book. While his magnificent hairstyle is distinct, he has no \"nimbus\" or cloud of glory behind his head. Who is he and what was in the missing lower panels ?</P>
<P>Look at the two sketches below. Compare this Ilkley man with the man in the Collingham Church carving. Whilst the hairstyle is similiar, notice how the Collingham man has a scroll, not a book. Perhaps the Ilkley man was a local priest? Ancient grave slabs show carvings of a priest With Bible and chalice.</P>
<P>The beasts on this shaft are entangled in strap-work, not plant forms. They are thought to be of an earlier Anglian style. Once again, the raised paw of the single beast can be seen on the lower panels. The triquetra knots are very clear in the tail, as at Collingham.</P>
<P>A very unusual feature of the central panel is a homed or long eared beast kicking up its hind leg. Experts have noticed similarities with the pattern on a coin of Eadberht, 737 -758 A.D.</P>
<P>Collingwood states \"the motif is so unusual that one can hardly doubt a connection. The relation of the beast to those on Eadbert\'s coins is made more convincing by the treatment of the hoofs.ln both they are drawn in a curiously conventional manner. which must mean that these stones are of the eighth century style of art.\"</P>
<P>The band of plait above the human figure is of a style found at Mensonby. Dewsbury , Otley and Kildwick, as well as in Scotland and the Midlands. Notice the raised paw in the entangled beast. The shaft is considered to be the oldest of the three, around 750 A.D.</P>
