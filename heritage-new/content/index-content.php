<h1>RISEN FROM ROMAN REMAINS</h1>

<p><strong>The rich history of All Saints Ilkley dates back to 627 AD, when Christians first worshipped on this site. The first church here is thought to have been built from stone taken from the abandoned Roman fort of Olicana, which had previously stood on this&nbsp;spot.</strong></p>

<p>The magnificent building we see today is in part medieval, but was largely rebuilt in Victorian times and even underwent some twentieth-century additions. Despite these developments over time, the Gospel message itself has never changed: 'Jesus Christ is the same, yesterday, today and forever.'</p>
