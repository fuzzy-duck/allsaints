              <P>Notice the Nails and Crown of Thorns placed on the ground in the bottom right window. Joseph of Arimathea, the rich member of the Sanhedrin, who was "looking for the kingdom of God" and was a disciple of Jesus "but secretly for fear of the Jews", is seen in the left foreground. He gave his tomb for Jesus.</P>

              <P>The window was designed for Wailes by F.W. Oliphant. The same design was used in 1856 by Oliphant, now freelance, at the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul, Deal, Kent.</P>
              <P></STRONG>This window is from before the church rebuilding and enlargement in 1861. A line drawing of the church in 1856 shows the previous Chancel with similiar size windows. <BR><!-- Start relational links --><BR></P>
