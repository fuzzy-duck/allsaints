              <P><STRONG>Dedication</STRONG>:&nbsp; JUNE 4TH 1871 THIS WINDOW WAS ERECTED BY HIS WIDOW AND ONLY SON TO THE MEMORY OF BENJAMIN BRIGGS OF BEACON HILL WHO DEPARTED THIS LIFE JUNE 4TH 1871</P>
              <P><STRONG>Notes</STRONG>: A window with three lights and four tracery panels. Christ blesses his disciples as He leaves them, watched by two winged angels. There are 12 figures, 11 male and one female. Judas had committed suicide and Matthias had yet to be chosen.</P>
              <P>This window suffers from pigment loss due to unstable paints caused by bad firing and possibly the fact that this was previously a cold, unventilated area of the church, allowing a build up of condensation on the window.</P>
              <P>Thomas Ward (1808 - 1870) and Henry Hughes (1822-1883) ran a studio in London with a prolific output of stained and painted glass. After Hughes' death, the firm was taken over by a relation, T F Curtis and continued production as Curtis, Ward and Hughes until the late 1920s.</P>
