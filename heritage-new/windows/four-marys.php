              <P><STRONG>Studio</STRONG>: J. Henry Dearle for William Morris and Co, August 3 1922</P>
              <P><STRONG>Dedication</STRONG>:&nbsp; TO THE GLORY OF GOD AND IN MEMORY OF HENRY JANE LEGGE AND THOMAS JAMES AND BESSIE CRITCHLEY ERECTED 1922</P>
              <P><STRONG>Notes</STRONG>: This design was first used at St. Stephen’s, Tonbridge in 1910 and repeated at least 15 times with between two and four Marys. This window uses newly rediscovered medieval techniques of silver stain on the back of blue glass to create the greens, and the streaking of several colours in one glass. As with much other glass in this church, the glass is from Hartley Wood of Sunderland. (1843 - 1997).</P>
              <P>There are two William Morris windows in St. Margaret’s Parish Church, Ilkley, dated 1894 and 1902.</P>
              <P>The original window, which also includes St. Peter, St. John and three Marys is at Salisbury Church, Edinburgh ( 1906 )</P>
              <P>Since the time of St. Jerome in the 3rd century, there has been discussion about the number of ‘Marys’ present at the Crucifixion, three or four - The Blessed Virgin Mary, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and John and ‘the other Mary’ possibly the wife of Clopas? Some suggest that the last two Marys are one and the same!</P>
