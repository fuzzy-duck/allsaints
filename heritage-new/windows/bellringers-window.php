In each panel, two angelic figures praise God on a variety of musical instruments, while a peal of 12 bells ring above, and 3 bells below. While some windows are "out of the catalogue", or repeated in different churches, this window is a particular commemoration of Jasper Whitfield Snowdon.</P>

              <P>Careful inspection will show that it has been repaired on various occasions. It is the first window in this church made by a more local firm. Powell Brothers closed in 1905 and was eventually taken over by Picketts of Leeds. Pickett was Churchwarden of this church in 1927, and his son Arthur was Organist from 1939 - 1972. He was advisor on stained and painted glass for the Diocese of Bradford until 1986. (His sister, Miss Mary Pickett, resides in Ilkley (1998).)</P>
