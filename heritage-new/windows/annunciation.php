              <P><STRONG>Notes:</STRONG> Richard Clayton (1827- 1913) Coming from the North Country, Richard Clayton spent times at Leigh’s Art School and at the Royal Academy School of Sculpture. One of his first stained glass commissions was in St. Nicholas’ Church, Brighton in 1848.Alfred Bell (1832 - 1895)</P>
              <P>While they undertook other forms of church decoration and furnishings, they were artists first and foremost, using stained glass as their preferred medium. Business flourished and by the end of the 1860s they had 300 employees on their books, with specialists who painted backgrounds and grisaille, draperies, folds, texts, inscriptions, etc. At King’s College can be seen their immense West Window and at Bath Abbey the Great East Window. </P>
              <P>Clayton came from Silton on the borders of Wiltshire and Dorset. As a 15 year old he travelled to London and found a place in Gilbert Scott’s Studio in 1847. Clayton and Bell set up in business together around 1854. Their first work was a series of windows for the Nave Clerestory at Westminster Abbey in 1856 (destroyed in the Blitz of World War Two). Commissions followed in Rochester Cathedral and Sherborne Abbey. </FONT></P>
