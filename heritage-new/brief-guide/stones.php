                <h1>Roman Stones</h1>

                <p>After the Roman fort was abandoned, some of the stone was reused to build the church.</p>

                <p>Three stones now under the tower were extracted from the structure in 1919 and are clearly Roman.</p>
                
                <p>But the cuts and carvings on them show they were probably re-used as window lintels in an early Anglo-Saxon church building, and then recycled a second time when the present church tower was built.</p>
