                <h1>Bells in tower</h1>

                <p>A peal of eight bells hangs in the tower: three 17th Century bells, recast in 1845, and five more added by the Reverend John Snowdon and his three sons, Jasper, William and Henry, who all shared their fatherâ€™s great enthusiasm for bell-ringing.</p>

                <p>Then follows the cross and the cruel nails that pierced Jesus' hands and feet: "I often think about the cross and shut my eyes and try to see the cruel nails and crown of thorns and Jesus crucified for me. But even could I see Him die, I could but see a little part of that great love which like a fire is always burning in his heart...."- Words from the hymn "It is a thing most wonderful"</p>
