                <h1>Bells in tower</h1>

                <p>A peal of eight bells hangs in the tower: three 17th Century bells, recast in 1845, and five more added by the Reverend John Snowdon and his three sons, Jasper, William and Henry, who all shared their fatherâ€™s great enthusiasm for bell-ringing.</p>

                <p>When Jasper died in 1885, an historian and campanologist of national fame, muffled peals of bells were rung throughout the land in his honour.</p>
