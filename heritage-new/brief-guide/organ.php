                <h1>Organ & Oak Casings</h1>

                <p>
                The original organ was built in 1830, but the present
                three manual instrument was installed in 1882.

                </p>
                <p>
                There are over 3000 pipes in total, the tallest 16 feet high whilst the smallest measure only 2 inches!
                </p>
                <p>
                The two magnificent oak casings, made in 1953, were some
                of the last pieces of furniture hand-carved by Robert
                Thompson of Kilburn, whose signature trade-mark is
                a baby mouse in a nest.
