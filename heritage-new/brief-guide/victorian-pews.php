                <h1>Victorian Pews</h1>

                <p>The Victorian pews in
                    All Saints church are
                    decorated with carvings of
                    plants and flowers.</p>

                <p>These
                were commonly used by
                the Victorians in church
                decoration as symbols of
                new life, growth, and the
                cycle of life.</p>

                <p>We also see the
                    five-petalled White Rose
                    of Yorkshire, dating back
                    to the fourteenth century, when Edmund of Langley
                    founded the House of York as a regional branch of the
                    ruling House of Plantagenet.</p>
