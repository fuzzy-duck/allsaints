                <h1>Anglo-Saxon Stone Crosses</h1>

                <p>The three stone crosses in our church today are a small fraction of the carved stone crosses that were erected locally in the 8th or 9th centuries.</p>

                <div class="floatnone"><a data-fancybox="gallery" href="../../images/explore/03.jpg"><img src="../../images/explore/03.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>

                <p>These were probably preaching crosses, perhaps for people to gather around for outdoor worship or to listen to those preaching the new Christian message.</p>

                <p>Their Anglo-Saxon carvings depict subjects from the scriptures: literally books in stone.</p>
