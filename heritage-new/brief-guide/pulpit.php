                <h1>Pulpit</h1>

                <p>The carved pulpit dates from 1889 and its fine
                    carvings were worked
                    from an original oak
                    beam that was removed
                    from the church during
                    reconstruction work in
                    1860 when the nave and
                    chancel were extended.</p>
