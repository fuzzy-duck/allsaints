                <h1>Two Stone Pillars</h1>

                <p>When the nave was enlarged in the 1860s, two new pillars were added, both with carvings of plants and flowers.</p>

                <div class="floatnone"><a data-fancybox="gallery" href="../../images/explore/11.jpg" ><img src="../../images/explore/11.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>

                <p>On the North Aisle, a rose, a shamrock, a thistle and a daffodil, emblems of Queen Victoriaâ€™s United Kingdom.</p>

                <p>Such was the loss of life from every village and town in the land. (Those local men who gave their lives in the Second World War 1939-45 are specifically remembered in the side-chapel, across the transept, which was furnished as a Memorial to them in 1946</p>

                <p>On the opposite pillar in the South Aisle, are wheat, grapes, lilies, and acorns, the symbols for bread, wine, spiritual purity and strength, emblems of the Kingdom of God..</p>
