                <p>
                    Charles Tatham, shopkeeper, was not baptised or married in Ilkley. He is not listed among the pew
                    holders in 1796. Shopkeepers were "trade" and probably did not qualify. He married Mary, but dying
                    aged 27 at Christmas 1799, she was widowed at 24. She died in 1804 on August 23rd aged 29.

                    He must have been held in high esteem to qualify for a small brass, even on the floor, which
                    survived the 1860 rebuilding.
