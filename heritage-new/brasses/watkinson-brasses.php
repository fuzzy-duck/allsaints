                    Imagine Joseph Watkinson sitting in his pew, dated 1633, with his wife Mary and daughters Elizabeth
                    and Mary, perhaps with little Henery,aged two. His Will included "To the poor of Ilkley Parish 30s a
                    year for ever." He died in 1669,the year his son-in-law became Mayor of Leeds.
