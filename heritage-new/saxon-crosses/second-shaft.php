                <h1>SECOND SHAFT</h1>

                <p>
                    2. The second tallest shaft while severely damaged by centuries of service as a churchyard gate
                    post, has the most distinct carving of the three shafts. There is fine cable edging and rounded
                    scroll stems. It is interesting to compare the leaves and fruit bunches with those on the tallest
                    shaft. The detail on the second shaft is much finer. There are similarities, but clear differences
                    as well

                    The side with four panels shows two naked figures in the top panel. If they are Adam and Eve ( as at
                    Dacre,Cumbria), there would be also the Tree and the snake. They are too worn for us to be
                    absolutely sure. Beneath them are two beasts confronted and fighting. Compare them with the two
                    beasts beneath them, back to back, tails intertwined and heads confronted. Notice their distinct
                    hooves or paws, as compared with the lower parts of the beast above them. Paws are raised.

                    <strong>In part of the fourth panel,</strong> two pairs of birds sit happily in the boughs of a
                    tree.

                <p>
                    The birds in the cross-piece are feeding on fruit! The same bird theme can be seen on the opposite
                    side. Collingwood makes a suggested sketch of the restored panel, based on the head and feet. It is
                    interesting to speculate what would have been in the missing part of the panel which shows a bird
                    viewed from above (two eyes visible).

                    <strong>Of the three shafts this one shows design and workmanship of highest excellence. Collingwood
                        dates the shaft at 800 A.D., but while this may be so, I stand by my earlier observation that
                        the shafts would have been carved in succession and not at the same time.</strong>
